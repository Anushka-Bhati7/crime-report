ðŸ“Š Rajasthan Crime Analysis Dashboard â€“ Project Overview

# Project Goal
This project aims to develop an interactive and visually appealing dashboard using Power BI to analyze crime incidents across different districts of Rajasthan, India. The primary objective is to present crime data in a way that reveals hidden trends, assists in decision-making, and enhances public safety awareness.

# Dataset Description
The dashboard is based on a structured dataset containing sample crime records reported from various districts in Rajasthan. Each record provides essential information about a crime, such as the type, date, district, specific place, and whether an arrest was made.

Key Columns in the Dataset:

* Crime_ID: A unique identifier for each case
  
* Date: The date when the crime occurred
  
* Crime_Type: Nature of the crime (e.g., Theft, Robbery, Cyber Crime)
  
* District: The district where the incident was reported
  
* Place: Specific area or landmark within the district
  
* Arrest_Made: Indicates if an arrest was made (True/False)
# Dashboard Features
The Power BI dashboard includes a variety of visuals to represent the data effectively:

ðŸ”¹ Bar Chart â€“ Crimes by District

Displays the number of crimes reported in each district, helping identify high-crime zones.

ðŸ”¹ Pie Chart â€“ Crime Types

Visualizes the distribution of different types of crimes, highlighting the most frequent offenses.

ðŸ”¹ KPI Cards â€“ Total Crimes & Arrests

Shows summary statistics like total number of crimes and total arrests made.

ðŸ”¹ Table View â€“ Detailed Records

Provides a tabular representation of each crime, including date, place, and type.

ðŸ”¹ Interactive Slicers

Filters like Crime Type and District allow users to drill down into specific subsets of data for deeper insights.

# Insights from the Data

# Outcome
The result is a dynamic and insightful dashboard that allows users to explore Rajasthanâ€™s crime data from multiple perspectives. This visualization not only serves law enforcement or civic authorities but also showcases how data analytics can be used to derive actionable intelligence from even small-scale datasets.

This dashboard fulfills the internship deliverable by demonstrating skills in:

* Data cleaning and preparation
  
* Visualization using Power BI tools
